# mySQL Tech Layoffs
Data Cleaning and EDA in mySQL with the free Kaggle Layoffs Dataset and under the instruction of Alex The Analyst videos.

To extract more value from the EDA it would be beneficial to collect data on:

- employed tech workers by each country
- total employees per company
- size of industries in the world/listed countries

## Update
Integrated the newest version of the Kaggle dataset into a new database "layoffs_2020_2025" in "_update_to_2025.sql"
